porousMultiphaseFoam (PMF) for OpenFOAM
=======================================

About
-----

**PMF** is an open-source toolbox dedicated to simulation of flow and transport processes in porous media.

It is based on the OpenFOAM environment and therefore benefits from its multiple feature such as pre-and post-processing tools or parallel efficiency for example.

Read the `PMF documentation <https://porousmultiphasefoam.readthedocs.io/en/dev/>`_ for more information.

This toolbox needs only a standard OpenFOAM installation and is compatible with the two main forks: `www.openfoam.com <https://www.openfoam.com>`_ and `www.openfoam.org <https://www.openfoam.org>`_.


Documentation
-------------

For information about installation, usage or numerical details, you should read the `PMF documentation <https://porousmultiphasefoam.readthedocs.io/en/dev>`_

Improvements and bugs fixes are registered in the **ReleaseNotes.txt** file.

How to cite PMF
