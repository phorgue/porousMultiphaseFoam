### Solvers

- Global:

  -patchEvent are now automatically read by solvers inside fields file
  -keyword "eventTimeTracking" is used to constraint the solver to
  explictly compute solution at event time (source/patch events)

- groundwaterFoam

  - The non-convergence of the Picard's algorithm now forces the solver to
  recompute the time iteration reducing the time step
  - add specific storage term (Ss) to the Richards' formulation
  - adding by default the mass-conservative terms to head pressure equation
  (mixed-formulation). The old head-pressure formulation can be now obtained
  adding "massConservative false;" in transportProperties

- groundwater2DFoam

  - solver adapted to handle uniform or non-uniform infiltration event (also
  accept non-conformal mesh event => consider as uniform infiltration)
  - time-stepping is now based on the truncation error (see the notes for
  porousScalarTransportFoam)

- porousScalarTransportFoam
  
  - support for multiple transported species in a single case. Species are
  listed in a "species" wordList in the transportProperties dictionary. 
  Each species can have its own porousTransport parameters and dispersion
  model. These are found in sub-dictionaries of transportProperties, each 
  named the same as a species. The change is backward compatible (the absence
  of a list of species is taken to mean a single species with name "C", and
  species without their own sub-dictionaries have their properties read
  directly from transportProperties). This support has also been extended to 
  all transport solvers in the toolbox
  - epsTotal now defaults to 1
  - eps can now be passed either as a scalar or as a field
  - time-stepping is based on the truncation error related ot the time scheme
  used (Euler, backward or CrankNicolson) and specified by the "truncationError"
  keyword in system/controlDict. The relative numerical error is computed using
  dC3/dt3 or dC2/dt2 (depending on the time-scheme) and maintained below the
  user-defined value

- porousScalarTransport2DFoam

  - support for multiple transported species in a single case (see the notes
  for porousScalarTransportFoam)
  - epsTotal now defaults to 1
  - eps can now be passed either as a scalar or as a field
  - time-stepping is now based on the truncation error (see the notes for
  porousScalarTransportFoam)
  
- groundwaterTransportFoam

  - The non-convergence of the Picard's algorithm now forces the solver to
  recompute the time iteration reducing the time step
  - CSV output fixed
  - add specific storage term (Ss) to the Richards' formulation
  - adding by default the mass-conservative terms to head pressure equation
  (mixed-formulation). The old head-pressure formulation can be now obtained
  adding "massConservative false;" in transportProperties
  - support for multiple transported species in a single case (see the notes
  for porousScalarTransportFoam)
  - epsTotal now defaults to 1
  - eps can now be passed either as a scalar or as a field
  - time-stepping is now based on the truncation error for the species
   (see the notes for porousScalarTransportFoam)

- groundwaterTransport2DFoam

  - new solver coupling 2D water modeling (groundwater2DFoam) with 2D scalar
  transport (porousScalarTransport2DFoam)
  - support for multiple transported species in a single case (see the notes
  for porousScalarTransportFoam)
  - epsTotal now defaults to 1
  - time-stepping is now based on the truncation error for the species and
  hwater variations (see the notes for porousScalarTransportFoam)

### Libraries

- toolsGIS

  - uniformInfiltrationEventFile replaced by infiltrationEventFile
  infiltration for groundwater2DFoam can be uniform or non-uniform (value
  specified at each time for each cell in event file)

- eventFile

  - now accepts two successive identical dates with different values for
  imposing step variation.

- eventFlux

  - now accept zero flux field (phi=0)
  - FatalError is handle if fixed flux > 0 and phi = 0
  - new static function through wich solvers can designate a list to be
  populated with non-owning pointers to patchEventFiles associated with
  instances of this BC. This scheme replaces the previous method which used an
  IODictionary to communicate with solvers. If no list is passed, any
  eventFlux condition with an event file will trigger a fatal error.

- eventInfiltration

  - new static function through wich solvers can designate a list to be
  populated with non-owning pointers to patchEventFiles associated with
  instances of this BC. This scheme replaces the previous method which used an
  IODictionary to communicate with solvers. If no list is passed, any
  eventInfiltration condition with an event file will trigger a fatal error.

- porousModels

  - relativePermeabilityModel/capillarityModel has new function Se() which
  return effective saturation.

- multiscalarMixture

  - new class developed to support multiple species in transport solvers.
  Objects of this class can read the properties for all species in a case,
  and also contain their concentration fields. They also do most of the work
  required to support species source events ("eventFileTracerSource" entries); 
  however, time tracking cannot be handled internally by this class and 
  therefore solvers that support this type of events have to, on construction,
  refer to a list that will be populated with non-owning pointers to any event
  files that are found (otherwise the solver will be deemed incompatible with 
  this type of events and the presence of any "eventFileTracerSource" entry 
  will raise a fatal error).


### Tutorials

- fix event keywords in several tutorials

- cleaning configuration files removing useless keywords/dictionaries

- new 1D_eventFlux test case for time scheme efficiency comparison (Euler,
  backward, CrankNicolson)
