**********************
*** V1.5 (2017-09) *** Scalar transport with dispersion coefficients
**********************

### Solvers

- porousScalarTransportFoam

  - passive scalar transport solver in porous media with dispersion coefficient

### Libraries

- dispersionModels

  - models to compute the effective diffusion (or dispersion) in porous media (model with alphaT and alphaL is available).

### Bug fixes

- OpenFOAM 5.0 compatibility fixed

************************
*** V1.4.1 (2017-08) *** Bug fixes and toolbox cleaning
************************

### Toolbox cleaning (indent fixed)

### Bug fixes

- darcyFoam

  - Ua field is correctly written

- impesFoam

  - capillary term correctly computed ("fvc::interpolate(fvc:grad(Sb))" ==> "fvc:snGrad(Sb)")

- incompressiblePhase

  - test on phi header has been removed (useless and incompatibility with OpenFOAM 5.0)

**********************
*** V1.4 (2017-02) *** New solver for one-phase flow : darcyFoam
**********************

### Toolbox re-organization

### Solvers

- darcyFoam (new solver)

  - one phase flow solver similar to porousSimpleFoam but using the porousMultiphaseFoam toolbox's parameters.

### Bug Fixes

- anisoImpesFoam/impesFoam/groundwaterFoam

  - solver now update  phia or phib in SEqn.H only if Ua or Ub are fixedValue boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities (bug partially fixed in V1.3.1).


************************
*** V1.3.1 (2017-02) *** Parallel computation fixed
************************

### Bug Fixes

- anisoImpesFoam/impesFoam/groundwaterFoam

  - solvers does not update phia/phib in SEqn.H if boundary is a processor patch in order to avoid numerical instabilities.

**********************
*** V1.3 (2016-09) *** Introducing new Stability numbers and python script for tutorials execution 
**********************

### Compatibility fixed for OpenFOAM 4.0

### Solvers

- impesFoam

     - three stability numbers are now available : Coats, Todd and Courant (see doc for more informations)

- anisoImpesFoam

     - still two stability numbers (Coats and Courant) but minor changes to respect coding style (with impesFoam)

### Tutorials

- impesFoam

     - capillary cases modified to use the new Todd's number condition
    
- python scripts

     - runTutorials.py runs each tutorials from with end signal to check backward compatibility. Messages are [ OK ] or [ Error OpenFOAM ] or [ Error C++ ]

     - cleanTutorials.py cleans test cases from tutorialsList.py

**********************
*** V1.2 (2016-05) *** Relative permeability and capillary pressure laws can be heterogenous 
**********************

### Libraries

- capillarityModels

     - models now reads "constant/porousModels" folder to find parameters fields which can be heteroegenous. Switch to the transportProperties dictionary if file is not found.

- relativePermeabilityModels

     -similar to capillarityModels

### Tutorials

- impesFoam-tutorials

     - BuckleyLeverett/BrooksAndCorey case updated to use volScalarField parameters instead of transport properties

- groundwaterFoam-tutorials

     - 1Dinfiltration case updated to use volScalarField parameters instead of transport properties
	
### Bug Fixes

- impesFoam/anisoImpesFoam/groundwaterFoam

     - error between timestep used and timestep displayed

     - velocity BC updated before SEqn.H (or hEqn.H) for time-dependent conditions

- groundwaterFoam

     - change writeOpt for phitheta (useless field, only phi is used)

**********************
*** V1.1 (2015-09) *** New solver for groundwater flows (Richards' equation)
**********************

### Solvers

- groundwaterFoam (new solver)

     - solver added for solving Richards' equation (unsaturated soils)

- impesFoam/anisoImpesFoam

     - wellbore positions are optional
     - displays only the CFL chosen (Coats / Courant Number)
	
### Libraries

- capillarityModels

   - new functions for groundwaterFoam added in the pcVanGenuchen class (pcLinear and pcBrooksAndCorey does not work with groundwaterFoam)

### Tutorials

- groundWaterFoam-tutorials
 
     - validation case (1Dinfiltration) and example (realCase) added

### Bug Fixes

- impesFoam/anisoImpesFoam

     - parallel computation of min/max added

- porousBoundaryConditions

     - effective saturation corrected for Dirichlet boundary conditions

**********************
*** V1.0 (2014-10) *** First release of the toolbox, two IMPES-solvers for two-phase flow in porous media
**********************

- impesFoam (new solver)

     - two-phase flow solvers for isotropic porous medium (permeability K is volScalarField)
